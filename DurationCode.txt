####DATA VISUALISATION####

#check the spread of my response variable
hist(mydata$duration) 
#not normally distributed. it looks like poisson. right spread.
#Can't use poisson distribution as duration is not count data

#log-tranformation
hist(log10(mydata$duration)) 

#does duration change with treatment?
boxplot(duration~treatment, outline=FALSE, data=mydata)
#during the pesticide treatment the duration seems to be slightly higher

#does duration change with mass?
plot(duration~mass, data=mydata)
#it seems that mass has no effect on the duration
#check effect of treatments
abline(lm(duration[treatment=="control"]~mass[treatment=="control"], data=mydata), col="red")
abline(lm(duration[treatment=="pesticide"]~mass[treatment=="pesticide"], data=mydata), col="green")
#there seems to be no significant effects
#with pesticide treatment the duration is slightly higher (compared to the control treatment ) in small bees, but it becomes slightly lower with big bees

#BASIC MODEL
mod1<-lmer(log10(duration)~treatment + mass+study_day + max_temp + bout_type + (1|colonyID/UID) + (1|replication), data=mydata)
summary(mod1)
#mass is not significant but study day is a very important variable, therefore I assume that the effects of pesticides on bees foraging behaviour are CHRONIC!


#MAXIMAL MODEL
mod2 <-lmer(log10(duration)~treatment+mass+study_day + max_temp + bout_type + treatment:study_day + treatment:mass + (1|colonyID/UID) + (1|replication), data = mydata)
summary(mod2)
#treatment alone has no effect
#mass has no effect
#interaction between mass and treatment has no effect


#MODEL simplification
mod3 <-lmer(log10(duration)~treatment + study_day + max_temp + bout_type + treatment:study_day + (1|colonyID/UID) + (1|replication), data = mydata)
summary(mod3)


#variation explained by random factors
0.011/(0.011+0.001+0.024) #UID
0.001/(0.011+0.001+0.024) #replication
