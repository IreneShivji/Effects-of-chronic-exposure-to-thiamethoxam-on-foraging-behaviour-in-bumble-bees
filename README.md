This respository includes data and scripts that were used for a mini project for the MSC Ecology, evolution and conservation course at Imperial College of London.
These data were collected by a Master student at Imperial College of London between April 2017 and July 2017. This is not the full data set. The original dataset has been gone through an elaborate process of data filtering using R and Python. The dataset that I have uploaded is the filtered one, which is the one that has been provided to me and, therefore, the one that I used for my analysis.
